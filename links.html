More useful HTML tags:
bracket a href="path/to/hello.html">Click here! /a bracketclose
    <br>
: link to hello.html, some URL, or some other content marked by id by passing #id to href
<br>
bracket input type="radio" bracket close
<br>
Option 1 : radio-button option for a form, where only 1 out of all the options may be selected ``` html
There are lots of new useful tags with HTML5, but not all browsers, especially older browsers, will support these new features. Nonetheless, these new features can be used with increasing confidence that they will be rendered appropriately for a significant portion of users.

CSS selectors are used to select different parts of a website to style in particular ways.
Some common CSS selectors:
Select h1 and h2
  h1, h2 {
      color: red;
  }
Select all li that are descendants of ol (not necessarily immediate descendants
  ol li {
      color: red;
  }
Select all li that are immediate children of ol
  ol > li {
      color: red;
  }
Select all input fields with the attribute type=text
  input[type=text] {
      background-color: red;
  }
Select all buttons with the pseudoclass hover
  button:hover {
      background-color: orange;
  }
A ‘pseudoclass’ is a special state of an HTML element. In this example, the state is whether or not the cursor is hovering over a button.
Select all before pseudoelements of the element a
  a::before {
      content: "\21d2 Click here: ";
      font-weight: bold;
  }
A ‘pseudoelement’ is a way to affect certain parts of an HTML element. In this example, the before selector applies content with its included styling before the contents of all a elements.
\21d2 is a hexadecimal value for a Unicode icon, which can represent symbols like emoji.
Select all selection pseudoelements of the element p
  p::selection {
      color: red;
      background-color: yellow;
  }
